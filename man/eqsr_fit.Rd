\usage{
eqsr_fit(stk, nsamp = 5000, models = c("Ricker", "Segreg", "Bevholt"),
  method = "Buckland", id.sr = NULL, remove.years = NULL, delta = 1.3,
  nburn = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{stk}{FLStock object}

\item{nsamp}{Number of samples (iterations)}

\item{models}{A character vector containing sr-models to use. User can set
any combination of "Ricker", "Segreg", "Bevholt", "Smooth_hockey".}

\item{method}{A character vector. Currently only "Buckland" is implemented.}

\item{id.sr}{A character vector specifying an id for the stock recruitment
model. If not specified (default) the slot "name" in the FLStock is used.}

\item{remove.years}{A vector specifying the years to remove}

\item{delta}{A value, used in method "Simmonds" (not implemented)}

\item{nburn}{An integer, used in method Simmonds (not implemented)}
}
\value{
A list containing the following objects:
\itemize{
\item fit data.frame containing the alpha (a), beta (b), cv and model names.
The number of rows correspond to the value set in nsamp in the function call.
\item pred A vector of predicted recruitment values. The length of the vector
corresponds to the value set in nsamp in the function call.
\item fits The parameters in the stock recruitment model corresponding to the
"best fit" of any given model.
\item data data.frame containing the recruitment (rec), spawning stock
biomass (ssb) and year used in the fitting of the data.
\item stknam A character vector containing stock name
\item stk FLStock object, same as provided as input by the user.
